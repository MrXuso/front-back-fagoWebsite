# FagoLambda Website

I'm making a simple website with back and front that will host biology articles.

## Backend
Usign currently a simple NodeJS that manage the DB (PostgreSQL) that include users, articles, tags and some more stuff.
There's a simple middleware that check user login, register and superuser.
DB schema still need a bit more of work to adjust correctly to requisites.

## Frontend 
Using Vue + Tailwind CSS to show articles, a simple writters page and a place to write and review articles.


### All this work will produce a real product but everything is made just to learn
